Things I’ve Learned Working Collaboratively In a Remote Environment

### “The key to an ideal workplace, in one hyphenated word, is this: self-awareness. - Neil Blumenthal

Make sure to practice self-awareness on top of being aware of the environment. It is very easy to accidentally interrupt somebody on a Zoom call. It happens often, but what happens after can really affect the mood of the meeting overall. Usually, the person or people who spoke at the same time will simply say “Sorry, go ahead” and somebody continues the discussion. But what happens when a person does not realize that they are completely speaking over other participants with blatant disregard? How do you prevent this from happening in the future?

This can be a tricky situation to navigate. In my experience, if I’ve noticed somebody else is being interrupted, I circle back with them after and ask them for their thoughts to try to make sure that they are being heard. In bigger groups, this can be more difficult because you obviously don’t want to look like a “white knight” and further belittle the person who is on the receiving end of the interruption. Sadly, in these situations sometimes it is best to just reserve any reactions and let the person who was interrupted decide if they want to attempt to get their point across or just stay quiet.

In smaller group settings, however, these are some of the most important things I've made sure to keep in mind and practice in order to create a productive environment.

1. Listen to what your teammates contribute.

    Don’t just hear what your teammates say, but make sure to listen to them. Show that you are listening by actually discussing what they are suggesting. Even if you don’t like the idea at first, it is important to talk about what was presented in order to understand their perspective and why it was presented.

2. Be willing to compromise
	
    Just like you might not have liked another person’s idea, they might not like yours either. It’s important to discuss ideas and suggestions openly with each other. Discuss the pros and cons of implementing certain functionality. Although it may seem tactless, it may be helpful to discuss what you don’t like about the idea as that offers the person who suggested it to either build a case for it and to present what they like about what they’ve suggested. And vice versa, if they are not particularly fond of an idea you’ve presented, it gives you the opportunity to present a case for it. It may change your mind or theirs. And at the end of the discussion, one party has to be willing to compromise.

3. If somebody is presenting something and you feel that they are incorrect, don’t just derail them to correct them.
	
    Having tact and being able to navigate situations like these are of the utmost importance to creating an environment in which everybody feels comfortable presenting their ideas. If somebody is incorrect about something, instead of jumping down their throat and derailing them, it’s important to discuss the topic and diplomatically present the alternative point that you feel is correct. And most importantly, DO NOT TRY TO EDUCATE YOUR CONTEMPORARIES. At the beginning on the Flatiron program we all reviewed an agreement on offering feedback to our cohort mates. Not everybody is open to hearing your version of the material we all read. If you want to show somebody the “correct” answer or an alternative way of doing something, always cite the documentation and point them to that documentation, but never try to educate them, unless they have indicated that they are open to learning from you.

4. If there is an idea that you want to discuss, do it!
	
    “Closed mouths don’t get fed.” This is a popular saying that I have heard many times in my career. Innovation only comes from openly discussing ideas and exploring different scenarios. These scenarios and discussions can only be had if they are sparked.

5. Don’t take a rejection of your ideas personally.
	
    I know during Phase 1 of my coding bootcamp, I wanted to implement a ton of functionality to a group project. Not everyone in my group wanted to implement these ideas, so we scrapped some of them. After presenting a case for them, my teammates were still not feeling some of them. One of my teammates suggested an alternative that ended up working much better. I compromised, as I’m sure they also compromised on some things.

Overall, creating an environment where everybody is being heard and respected is ideal to working remotely in a collaborative effort.
